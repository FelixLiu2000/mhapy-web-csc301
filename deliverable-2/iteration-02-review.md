# MHAPy Team 17

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.

##### written with the timeline in mind: when we just found out that the team is down to 2 people, Xi Yu (Kristin) Huang and Felix Liu.

## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: April 27, 2021
 * Where: Online via Zoom

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

#### Decision 1: Weekly team meeting on Monday 

Our team decided to have weekly team meetings on Monday at a set time when everyone would be available. This proved to be a successful decision as it allowed everyone on the team to come together in a mandatory session. During this mandatory session, we were able to check on progress and set weekly goals. This helped everyone to keep expectations aligned on the status of the project. We were also able to divide tasks accordingly so everyone worked on an equal and manageable chunk. So this helped us to plan our project and keep us on track. In addition, during the meeting, we were able to discuss any project related issues such as code design, code style, and more. This helped us to keep the codebase cohesive.

#### Decision 2: Setting roles and responsibilities

Our team set up roles and responsibilities of each team member in deliverable 1. Xi Yu (Kristin) Huang's role is UX/UI design, Su Young Lee's role is DevOps, Felix Liu's role is back-end integration, and Magomed Evloev's role is front-end development. Setting up the roles helped everyone to focus on their area of strength. Although two group members dropped the course midway, the remaining group members Xi Yu (Kristin) Huang and Felix Liu used the starting roles as a base for their new responsibilities. It was decided that Xi Yu (Kristin) Huang would focus on UX/UI design and front-end development, where Felix Liu would focus on DevOps and back-end integration. Setting the roles helped Felix and Kristin to divide up responsibilities and they could work separately to make things more efficient.

#### Decision 3. Biweekly client meeting

The biweekly client meeting allowed us to periodically check in with the client with questions and progress updates. The meeting done through zoom allowed us to get immediate responses for any project related questions, whether it be questions about the API or the client database. Zoom meetings are better than communicating via email because it allowed for faster response time in person. And with zoom, we could share our screen and demonstrate live the code and application, which helped with visualizing and explaining the problem. Additionally, the biweekly client meeting is good because it kept the client updated on our progress. This helped to keep us accountable and the client would be able to make any comments about the features that we were writing.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

#### Decision 1: Poor Usage of Process Artifact Trello

In our deliverable 1, we planned to use Trello to keep track of the overarching features we need to implement by using Trello as a sprint backlog. Unfortunately, we didn't barely used Trello. Instead, we divided our work into broad sections (e.g. working on the login page, working on the chat page, etc). We thought that we would be okay with a general direction and found traditional Trello project management dashboards to be unnecessarily detailed. We didn't think deeply about what each of the page needed in terms of specific features and the acceptance criteria of each feature. However, looking back, using Trello effectively would greatly improve our team's working process. First, it would help to break each section down into specific implementable features with acceptance criteria. This would help the team to feel less lost and overwhilmed. In addition, Trello allows everyone to constantly update their progress in a visual way, so the team would be able to see which features are in development and which features are in the backlog. So instead of updating our porgress every week, the progress updates would be more frequent and communication would be easier.

#### Decision 2: Lack of scheduled and mandatory code sessions

Although we planned mandatory weekly team meetings to discuss progress and goals, we did not have pre-scheduled and mandatory code sessions. We thought we would be flexible with holding code sessions as needed. However, we didn't end up having any code sessions. We believe the lack of scheduled code sessions caused difficulties because people procrastinated on the project without mandatory code sessions. For example, the two teammates that dropped, Su Young Lee and Magomed Evloev, did not contribute to the code repository at all. This is likely because they had trouble managing their time and dedicating time to the 301 project. If we had scheduled 

#### Decision 3: Communication via Messenger group



 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Q3. Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
